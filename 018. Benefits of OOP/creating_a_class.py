# a class - is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the data (attributes)
# and the behaviors (methods) that the objects created from it will have.

# Class = blueprint / template
# Object (instance) = actual item created from that blueprint.

# Why do we use classes?
# Classes let you:
    # Group related data and functions together
    # Organize code better
    # Reuse code
    # Represent real-world things in programming (like a car, student, bank account, etc.)

# Basic Structure of a Class:

# class naming convention use the PascalCase (ex: UserCountSize)

class User:
    pass            # pass - continue to the next line of the code

user_1 = User()
