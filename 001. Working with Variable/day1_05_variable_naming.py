# Variable Naming Rules:
# 1. Make sure your variable names are descriptive
# 2. Don't have spaces between words.
# 3. Don't start with numbers.
# 4. Don't use special words like print or input.

name = input("What is your name: ")
length = len(name)
print(length)

# NameError: a NameError happens when you try to use a name 
# (usually a variable or function) that Python doesn’t know yet.
