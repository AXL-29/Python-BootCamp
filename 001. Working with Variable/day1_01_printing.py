# print() function - show or display an output.
# "" or '' - use to define the set of string not code.
# SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal - means that the interpreter reached 
#              the end of a line (EOL = End Of Line) while it was still expecting the end of a string 
#              — in other words, a string wasn’t closed properly.
